<p>I've refamiliarized myself with Github navigation, and the process of creating repositories. However, my computer is unable to utilize the terminal commands for Github, making the first part of the lab impossible to perform. I will be updating my MacOS in the mean time in hopes of it rectifying the problem. Anyhow, I've learned the basics of HTML. Such as basic structure, HTML tags, and hyperlinks. I've also intalled the Apache NetBeans IDE, and learned how to add multiple files into one project.</p>
